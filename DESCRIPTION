Title: Simulates Data from a Data Frame of Different Variable Types
Version: 1.0
Date: 2016-05-25
Description: Generates fake data from a dataset of different variable types.
    The package contains the functions simulate_dataset and simulate_dataset_ts 
    to simulate time-independent and time-dependent data. It randomly samples 
    character and factor variables from contingency tables and  numeric and 
    ordered factors from a multivariate normal distribution. It currently supports the 
    simulation of stationary and zero-inflated count time series.
